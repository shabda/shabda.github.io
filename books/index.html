<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I have been reading books for as log as I remember. Some of the books I love are LOTR, ASOIAF, Foundation Saga, Dune series, Discworld. I like books with vast, expansive worlds and gray characters. I also love hard science fiction. </p>

<h2>Authors</h2>
<p>
    I like Asimov for his prolificity, I like Martin for introducing realism to fantasy and I like Pratchett for his skill with words.
</p>

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>
    I am inspired by Banksy, and I think (some) games are art.
