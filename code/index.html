<h2>Python & Django</h2>
<p class="family">
    I worked with many languages before I found Python. Python just clicked with the way I think about things, and has been my go-to programming language ever since. Django provides the perfect mix of flexibility and batteries included for the work I do.
</p>

<h2>Javascript & more</h2>
<p>If you use the web as a medium, you need to be good at Javascript, HTML, CSS and bunch of other technologies. I am handy with all of them. I prefer using Less and Coffeescript whenever I can.</p>



<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>
    Its amazing what having a small, always connected computer can do. We are yet to realize the potential of what this pervasive computing will do. I prefer Android to iOs, and I prefer Java to Objective-C. I prefer Python to either, but being pragmatic, I will code in Java and Obj-C when needed.
