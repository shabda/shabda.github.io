<h2>Agiliq</h2>
<p>
    We started Agiliq in 2009 to build amazing apps. We work with Django, Python, Javascript, Java for Android, Cordova and many other tools. We prefer using open tools whenever possible, but we are pragmatic about it.
</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>
    I love open source. My business and my life has benefitted immensely from open source, so I try to give back in any way I can.
</p>

<h2>People</h2>
<p>
    The most valuable part of any software company is its people. I am grateful to the many people, our clients and the team Agiliq, who work with me.
